# Where Is My Chest #

This is a SPA using [vue.js](https://vuejs.org) to figure out which sequence of [Clash Royale](http://supercell.com/en/games/clashroyale/) chest cyle I am in, based on my past chest pattern.


## Acknowledgement ##

The chest cycle logic used here is referred to this article, [How does the Chest Drop? &ndash; Clash Royale Chest Cycle](http://clashroyalearena.com/tips/how-does-the-chest-drop).


## Getting Started ##

Here's the letters representing each chest.

* `S`: Silver Chest
* `G`: Gold Chest
* `I`: Giant Chest
* `M`: Magical Chest
* `U`: Super Magical Chest
* `E`: Epic Chest
* `L`: Legendary Chest
* `X`: Draw or Lost Game

Based on your previous games, just put the sequence into the text box and possible chest cycle will be displayed.
